--------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: [August 27th, 2020]

****************
A Genix example has been added to the source code: genix_backpack_example.
The example features examples of using text, grids, the centered constraint, component events, and tooltips.
****************

- The order of constraints added to a component no longer matters.

- Setting the visibility of a ui_component doesn't change their position in the sprite group when they are made visible again.

- Added a "Centered" constraint.  You no longer have to use both "CenterX()" and "CenterY()" for constraining a component to it's parent's center.

- Added more genix colours.  They are all listed in the new documentation.

- You can now set tooltips on UI Components using set_tooltip(component)

- set_visible can how hide all of a UI Container's children

	* Call with set_visible(visibility=False, affect_children=True)

	* If this is called as set_visible(visibility=False, affect_children=False) only the UI Container background itself will be hidden.

- Text components no longer have to be updated everytime the text changes.

- Setting the alpha of text now works.

- Text components now change scale based on screen size automatically without the need to add the RelativeWidth/RelativeHeight constraints yourself.
